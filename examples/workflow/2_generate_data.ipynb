The `create_helicity_kinematics()` helper function builds a ``Kinematics`` object following the specifications in the XML model file. The second argument of this function is a particle list, which can be created with the `read_particles()` function. The created ``Kinematics`` object can be used to generate a phase space sample as well.\n",
