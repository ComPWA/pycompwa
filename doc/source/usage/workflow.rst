ComPWA Workflow
===============

In the following pages, we show how to use ComPWA via the Python interface.
We illustrate this workflow with the decay
:math:`J/\psi \rightarrow \gamma \pi^0 \pi^0`, using the helicity formalism.

Usually, you go through the following four steps to perform your analysis:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :glob:

    workflow/*

:doc:`Letâ€™s go! <workflow/1_create_model>`

.. note::

    Each of these steps can be downloaded as Jupyter notebooks `here
    <https://github.com/ComPWA/pycompwa/tree/master/examples/workflow>`_. The
    notebooks have been written in such a way that you can rerun each of the
    steps separately once you have the output files of the previous steps. As
    such, these notebooks can be easily used for your own partial-wave
    analysis, even if they require much computation time!
