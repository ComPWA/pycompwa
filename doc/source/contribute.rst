How to contribute
=================

This page explains some of the tools that we use to work on `pycompwa`.

.. note::

  In order to work on the source code, you need to :doc:`work in a virtual
  environment </install/virtual-environment>` and have `pycompwa` installed in
  :ref:`developer mode <install/build:Developer Mode>`. You can then install
  the developer tools listed under `requirements-dev.txt
  <https://github.com/ComPWA/pycompwa/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt>`_ as
  follows:

  .. code-block:: shell

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

The ComPWA repositories are bound to continuously evolve as experimental and
theoretical insights progress. We therefore want the distinction between user
and developer to be as minimal as possible and aim to maintain an interactive
and dynamic platform for PWA software development.

The following pages guide you through some of the tools required to contribute
to this project.

Reporting Issues
----------------
Use the `pycompwa github issues page
<https://github.com/ComPWA/pycompwa/issues>`_ to:

* report problems/issues
* file a feature request
* request modifications to existing "unpleasant" code

Please don't hesitate to report any issues, but try make sure not to post
duplicates.

We are also very glad if you want to take it into your own hands and contribute
to one of the ComPWA repositories! It is easiest, however, if you first propose
the idea as an issue to receive feedback or perhaps even work on an idea
together.
