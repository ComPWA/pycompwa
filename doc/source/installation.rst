Installation
============

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`pycompwa` is `available as a PyPI package
<https://pypi.org/project/pycompwa/>`_. However, since the `pycompwa.ui` module
contains Python bindings to the `ComPWA backend
<https://github.com/ComPWA/ComPWA>`_, you first need to install certain C++
prerequisites.

What you definitely need to install, is:

* a build tool: `cmake <https://cmake.org/>`_
* a C++ compiler:
  `gcc <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ or `clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_
* `Boost <https://www.boost.org/>`_
* `Python3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

The following package are optional:

* `ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root>`_ and/or `Minuit2
  <http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/>`_
* `GSL <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_
* `Geneva <https://www.gemfony.eu/>`_

It is highly recommended to install ROOT `with Minuit2 enabled
<https://root.cern.ch/building-root>`_. Without it, ComPWA will have only
limited functionality.

.. hint::

  If you have a Linux machine with `apt <https://wiki.debian.org/Apt>`_ and
  with administrator rights, you can run the following:

  .. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install -y cmake gcc git libboost-all-dev python3

  ROOT with Minuit2 can be most easily installed by `downloading a suitable
  binary for your machine <https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root>`_.


Installation through pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can install `pycompwa` through
`pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_. You also need to install `scikit-build
<https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, because it is used as a
build tool for the ComPWA backend:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install scikit-build
  pip install pycompwa

Et voil√†, that's it! You can try out whether the installation works by running:

.. code-block:: python

  import pycompwa

from the Python interpreter. If that works, you can try out some of the
examples from the :doc:`/usage/workflow` page.

Note that :command:`pip` **only allows you to install specific releases**. We
therefore recommend following the :ref:`interactive installation
<installation:Interactive installation>` procedure instead.


Interactive installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`pycompwa` is an academic research project and is bound to continuously evolve.
We therefore highly recommend installing `pycompwa` from `the source code
<https://github.com/ComPWA/pycompwa>`_, so that you work with the latest
version.

Moreover, since you read as far as this, you must have an interest in
partial-wave analysis, and it is researchers like you who can help bring this
project further! So please, have a look through the following sections to set
up this 'interactive installation':

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  install/get-the-source-code
  install/virtual-environment
  install/build

After that, it's worth having a look at the :doc:`contribute tutorials
<contribute>`!
