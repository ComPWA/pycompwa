About pycompwa
--------------

pycompwa is a collection of python modules and the python interface to
`ComPWA <https://github.com/ComPWA/ComPWA>`_. ComPWA stands for
"Common Partial Wave Analysis framework".

Analogous to ComPWA, ``pycompwa``'s focus is also modularity. ``pycompwa``
extends the ComPWA framework with some useful modules:

* :ref:`expertsystem <compwa-expert-system>` |br|
  An amplitude/intensity model generator

* :ref:`ui <python-ui>` |br|
  The python interface to ComPWA
